Field dedicated to understanding the human aspect of builidng systems, so making actual practical applications for a given type of user to geniuely help with a problem.

Few things come under this, whether it be UI/UX designers, researchers, beta tests, primary test stakeholders.

1 model is the USD Model, User specified model that the process of problem solving with 
Empathising, so gaining a wider understanding of the issue and system and wants and needs.
Defining so narrowing it down to the actual changes and things that would need to be done.
And then iteratively continuing the next few processes until satsified

Evaluating, building prototypes and demos to get across the idea and to see if you're heading in the right,
Taking that feedback and continuing further until you and customer are  happy.

So user feedback, concerns and wants are always at the forefront. 

----------

There are different types of users and their involvmenet in the project. You could have Users during the entire process that help constantly feed in to the project and help guide, working as a designer.

The other options are intresteed customers so they can attend workshops, questionaires, potentially test your system to see if it works for them.

Our project design definition is entirely made of requirements, so what does our project need to do to complete it's goal to a high and complete but reasonable standard.
Most important things are for these requirements to be specific, clear and unambigous. You and others will return to these requirements 1000 times and you should be able to understand it each and every time and see how it relates to wider issue and tackling the problem at hand.

Fuctional Requirements:
---

What our project should be able to do
e.g. Send an email to a user

Non-Functional Requirements:
---
HOW our project should be able to do these things (adding constraints and expections to our functional requirements)
e.g. it should take at most 20 seconds to pull archive data for a year
e.g. System should at most be able to handle 30 live users at any given time
