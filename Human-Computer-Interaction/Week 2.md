This week is all about building the requirements and understanding of the users via questionnaires. Interviews in order to get useful specific and relevant data to help learn about the issue.

The perfect solution might not even involve technology or a problem may be provided but without a proposed solution. Or certain issues might not even be considered geinune problems when perhaps they should be or they geinuely should just be ignored.

General rule for questionaires is to just keep it specific and helpful. You should be able to do something and gain a better understanding with results. Good grammar, clarity in writing, right balance of understanding the wider context but also focusing on relvant issues when need be.
