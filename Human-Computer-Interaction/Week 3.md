More time spent on the process of that intial set of useful user requirements to help narrow down and structure the more detailed design process which is to come.

Two topics of discussion although they are both related with data gathering and handling process.

Ethonograpy
---

One being the field of ethnography. The study of groups and impartial and fair observer. Essentially placing yourself as neutrally and unthreatingly  as possible in order to intergrate yourself with a community to understand "what's going on".

In our case, it's going to be a bit more focused on some issue, so if our issue is seeing how we can help people with colonoscopy  bags. We might just follow them around and see how they interact with the technology. 

They might take the bag off before important situations, be quiet when talking about it, might be too bulky and difficult to use, might lack decent enough volume, hard to dispose of etc. We're just gathering the information first to find out what the issue (if any) is with a system, and what could be done to address it.

Personas
---
Personas are sort of the after math of the research by making the ideal fictional user based on the data gathered from users. The most average user possible. What do they do, what do they struggle with, what's their day to day movement and life like etc. With all of our data collected what does the average user look like and do?

With that we can build systems for this user, how would they interact with our system, would it replace what they were doing before, what problems might they have with our suggestions etc.

Forces us to crtically think and our analsyse the data we've collected to move forward with what we think our users would geniuenly benefit from.

There are 3 layers involved  with making a persona.

1. establishing requirements
2. elaborating requirements
3. Making them human
