# Day planner

## Requirements
- Finish report and implementation section today today.
- Read through it again and check it. If possible, reduce it to 8000 words (not including tables)
- Start coding, and create screen shots for those key sections for the appendix.


As it stands, Going to finish report across today and tomorrow (some work on Sunday if necessary)

- So 15% penalty, which should be fine enough to pass.
- Can apply for extenuating circumstance if necessary
- Need to register with GP.
- Can book a meeting to discuss strategies and approach with well being

- For now just focus on report, structure and completing design necessary for code

If i finish those main sections, I can then go home and sleep for a few hours but redrafting it and
