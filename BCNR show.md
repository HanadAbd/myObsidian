Friday, April 11th
BCNR Show at Birmingham Town Hall
6:26 waiting in line outside of town hall

After doing a lot of nothing that day, I left early at 16:00 to be there by 19:00 and ideally get some earplugs in the mean while. Wasn't able to unfortunately but after grabbing a coke, I waited in line leaning against a wall. Briefly a guy my age, with circle glasses, long curly hair and leather jacket asked, if the line was for the show. Beyond that though, the Wait. 

After waiting an hour and leaning against a wall with glasses smoking guy, we got in at 19:00, and everyone came pouring in. A little issue with ticket vendor used but i was just allowed to come in regardless, through it's open double door and rushed to the front of the standing stall. Weirdly, everyone pushed to the front against the raling, even in a mostly empty room, but in retrospect, i should of done the same.

Standing beside me, were a groups of friends such as a towering man next to his girlfriend in front of me, or a couple to my right, that jumped with every kick drum beat. Almost everyone there was the same university age as me, with the exception of older couples in the seated stalls behind me in the higher up rows. Beyond even that though, the longer wait for around 40 minutes.

Opener

Before BCNR came up, an opener performed. Couldn't find the name but consisted of drummer and brief melodica player *Charlie* Wayne of BCNR as well as a female vocalist and violinist dressed in a white dress, and cellist and guitar players. Similar to forever howlong, it was mostly baroque and chamber pop, similar to ichiko ioba it soft heavenly singing with deep moving strings accompanying it. The singer mentioned she hasn't sang in front of a crowd often, but you couldn't tell. I thought, since the drummer was there, they were a cover band or something and were playing songs of the new album. And I wouldn't have minded that at all. Very cool.

BCNR!!!

After a brief (not too brief, it was like 40 minutes) intermission, which I had to ask the person next to me what was going on, the room got dark. Light's dimmed but the room got excited. With Led Zeppelin's *Whole lotta Love* playing and smoke emitting from the edges of the stage, they came. Jumping and running across the stage and waving at the crowd was BCNR. Settling into their sits and giving a big hello, *Gerogia, the violinst* stated they were going to play their new album for us, *Forever Howlong*. She began with *besties* and continued to perform hit after hit.
It was loud as shit, compared to the opener which was less rock focused, this was damn defining with drums, but even beyond that, for a song with just strumming of guitars and singing, the harmonies felt overwhelming. But for the most part, I really loved. The singing of each the girlies were beautiful, and although perhaps being a bit too consistent, song's didn't feel repeated. Earlier into the show, I was bit shy, about blocking the people next to me so didn't record as much as I should've. That being said It should be note the stage was littered with instruments, and band members were constantly swapping out their tools, with Georgia especially, beyond playing violin, and Oboe at one point with the rest of the band, played like 3 different types of bard guitars.

Miscellaneous things

Small curiosities that I think are worth mentioning

- The drummer during the nosier sections of rock songs like *Nancy tries to take the night*, his glasses would constantly fail to stay on, and need constant adjustment. Goggles would be better but that might be a bit cringe.
- Lewis, Georgia and Tyler but most Lewis were alternating with the *Palestine Guitar*, at least a guitar with water melon stickers. Should mention Tyler's Bass did also have full water melon circle
- It's really weird how exciting some songs were, that it made me completely forget how tight and tired my back felt. Although, immediately after it ended, I was hurrying to sit down next to steps next to 


After the show

Just like that, the show ended, and I had to go home. There was a lot of cheerful chatter and people seemed to really enjoy the performance. But even though was also excited and immediately knew it would be one of my happiest moment, I felt guilty. I was unfocused multiple times, didn't engage with anyone meaningfully, was too shy to record the whole thing, and most importantly, worried about these things although they don't matter. Looking at the couple or students with their parents, or 2 drunk dudes, shoulder to shoulder shaking to music, I felt really out of place. I don't think I've put in the effort required to be apart of earth, that does frustrate me.

Sitting down on the steps of the fountain, I dwelled on my relationship with the Earth and Myself. Question's about the right to exist, to property, to health etc. came , got boring, then upset me all again. Despite how exciting being healthy look's the effort it to takes to get there seems infinite, and staying there is hard part. I think I'm kind but I'm not a neighbour, and I don't want to accept that's all that's left for me. I want to know if I can enjoy good expreiences even more then what I felt that day. I don't think i can do shit, until come up with answers and questions I can find peace in.

Inshallah, I become stronger, so the world seem's easier in comparison.
