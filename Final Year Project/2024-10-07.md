I want by Wednesday 12:00, to have a basic visual demo of Summerville done. For now, we'll stick with nodejs and typescript like we have so far.

Key functionality to be done:

- Data source credentials settings and configuration Page. Should be able to view, edit, add and delete credentials. Using a sort of post system for them (Don't worry about database for now). Just for visualisation, should be configurable for a few things e.g. database, excel, Kafka stream, AWS etc.
  
- Could do what Q_DAS did and have a program that configures a database  with their shared details to be the in the format required for this. Again, proof of concept, not necessarily done.
  
- Proof of concept of the Page Builder, With the Graph and page elements on the bottom, and the queries and the data sources on the left.
  
- I think a query builder like PowerBI's would be a nice start. Although for now, just doing regular sql queries for that corresponding database.

- Just some example data.
