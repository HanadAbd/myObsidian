Monster Door game:

Needs:

- Needs a way to store all the properties of each character that are relevant for that specific character.
  Name ; datatype ; range ; Initial Value
  For now that will be:
  
	  Player:
		  - Name; Char[];20; myPlayer 
		  - Health; int; 0-20, 20
		  - Loudness; int; 1-100; 20
		  - Perception; int; 1-100; 30
		  - Open_door;Boolean; TRUE
		  - Speed;int;1-100; 100
		    
		  - Position_x; int;0-MAP_COLUMN_LENGTH; 0
		  - Position_y; int;0-MAP_ROW_LENGTH; 0

	  Monster:
		- Name; Char[];20; Monster
		- Attack; int; range from 1-100; 100
		- Aggression; int; 1-100; 50
		- Loudness; int; 1-100; 70
		- Perception; int; 1-100
		- Open_door; Boolean; False
		- Speed; int; 1-100; 50
		
		- Position_x; int;0-MAP_COLUMN_LENGTH; 10
		- Position_y; int;0-MAP_ROW_LENGTH; 10

- Need a data type for obstacles. so WALL, and DOOR. DOOR is the same as WALL so only property wall has is that it has a Boolean of block and transparent, which is unchangeable and TRUE/FALSE accordingly.
  DOOR is an extension of WALL so has property of open, which makes it not blocked and transparent. But it can also have multiple other functions such as LISTEN and properties for those who can open it. For now, just PEEK. Which makes the door transparent.

- Need to some how have a 2d map so a double array that is filled with pointers to objects that are on it. So usually NULL, but can have either a DOOR, WALL, MONSTER or PLAYER. Probably best to just point to the id of the object since otherwise, you'd have to account for every datatype
  
- Need to some how initialise the properties of each map. For now just manually initialise the double array.

- A event tick system. So a character can only do a certain action per event  of a tick, so an event can only happen per tick, and how many ticks that are required to do something is dependent on the speed stat of the character.
  
- Silly me, instead of classes, we can have struct, which will define variables but also function pointers. And with that we can have variables and methods just like regular OOP. So we can even have array of function pointers, so pointers assigned to that given class

So let's begin.

Different Stages of Test:

1:48 - 2:00

struct typedef{
- "id" : 0;
- "name" : Door";
- "symbol" : "@";
- "blocks" : TRUE;
} Door

Do the rest for each char.

int TILESET [ 4 ] = {the id of each object, so in our case, 4}
Set 2d array:

intÂ MAP [2]  [ 3 ] = {{Manually input the double array for the map}}

GenerateMap() should go through the MAP array and do malloc and create a pointer for each array
