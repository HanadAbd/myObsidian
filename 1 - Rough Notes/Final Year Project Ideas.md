- A reactive 3d sci-fi world.
- You play as an traveller and scientist that's learning more about this alien world, it's strange creatures and mysterious alien culture.
- I think the game should be of a pre-defined map with pre-defined entities, npc's and archetecture.
- The main draw is how the actions of the player, the enviroment and creatures cause the setting and creatures to be behave differently

Some ideas for changes that can occur:
- Weather mechanics: Increased snow fall can cause avalanches and rivers coming from the mountain that certain creatures rely on freeze over, causing them to move to different locations. Maybe potential flooding
- Creatures interacting with each other in some sort of eco system. Getting an idea of the food chain of a given area, invasive species
- I have to see how procedural animation would work and what it's limitations are. (I don't just want spiders and stuff that seems a bit boring)
