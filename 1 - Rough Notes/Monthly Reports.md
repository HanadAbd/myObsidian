- June 2023 progress report

The first month was mostly spent being taught by the previous interns as to how the different systems in the factory works. It was mostly a brief overview over using javascript, fixing some broken scripts done in C# and just learning PowerBI and Excel. Mostly importantly however, it was helping with my previous interns last task which was a webpage. So he showed me how it was hosted on a windows server, how to maintain the webpage as well as the process for submitting changes.
