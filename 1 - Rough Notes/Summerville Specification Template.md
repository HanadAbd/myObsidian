An app to make digital Twin's basically

Summerville is web app tackled to design creating a digital counterpart to any production enterprise and factory. A lot of factory and businesses has lots of data split up across multiple systems, databases and services. Especially if a lot of maintenance of the enterprise is reliant on 3rd party relationships, that data would be across multiple hard to access areas. So when it comes to getting certain KPI metrics in real time, you would have to look across multiple areas.
For any given time, how many people were at a given machine. How much down time has there been in across the last 4 weeks. How does performance this week compare against that of last week? What performance characteristics are even necessary and how would you even view them?

Summerville aims to make the process simple by allowing you to add all these sources of data to this one app, to easily configure it's appearance and design, generate custom kpi's figure's graph and information. And to also easily incorporate other PowerBI's , Excel's and Grafana Boards that appear in other locations.

Allows you to easily maintain the performance of how data is taken from a database, based on performance and requirements.

This app is designed for management, quality and maintenance of warehouses, and other businesses that run 24/7 operations and have to maintain and view multiple resources and assets at any given time.

There will be the main users but those who have admin access to that web app will able to make the configurations necessary if need be. For each app made, there will be a default style guide, list of KPI's as well as their requirements for those values, graphs and charts and more that will be editable.
