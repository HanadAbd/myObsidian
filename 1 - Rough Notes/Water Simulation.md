I want to make a 2d simulation game based on a ancient civilisation factory trying to make clean water for a town 

Elements i want
--
- Boiling the water station
- Sedimentation (Removing larger rocks and debris)
- Traveling the water across the stations and elsewhere
- A way to randomly change the dependents e.g. Weather, workers falling sick, damages or delays in shipments, different issues that the water can come in, damages and changes done to machine
- Ways to view the performance of each element
