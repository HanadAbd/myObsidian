Similar to the Hams Hall Digital Twin.

Aims to tackle the issue of lots of machines that exist on the same network or uploads lots of data and streams that data to a database to view live performance of that factory. Meant to be as modular possible, so a script or something on one of the PC's Machines to stream data to the database, or reading data from a database that a machine is currently already being uploaded too.

It get's all this data from all these locations (either storing it in our database and reading it from there or reading from data that is being uploaded too) and from there we can get multiple Kpi's, place it on to a map (maybe show a heat map), and have it be very modular in approach (shouldn't be hard to add or remove nodes), you can have a country view etc. To view different Kpi's and performance.

Adding Nodes
--

Can add nodes by connecting a pc to a network that this application runs and streams it's data to a postgres database.

For each node you can add to you can add it to the tree nodes under another root node. And can access all the data for it

You fill in a form for adding a node for a machine like name, what it does, key KPI targets, and what KPI's are relevant to it. Or making brand new custom Kpi's
