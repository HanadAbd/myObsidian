*definition::* Physical devices that connect multiple devices on LAN and use packet switching to forward data to the correct destination device. Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model and can also operate at the network layer (Layer 3) for routing purposes. They have memory to store packets temporarily and manage traffic efficiently. When the memory limit is reached, the switch may drop packets until it can process and forward existing data.
