***List of Questions and Topics:***

- List of applications that are relevant to my application as well as differences and how it achieves it's goal. (e.g. Apache Spark,PowerBI, Grafana, AWS Solution):
	  - **Amazon Kinesis** : Family of amazon services that allow processing and analysing real-time streaming data at a large scale
	  - **Grafana**: Grafana is an open-source analytics and interactive visualization platform to create dynamic, real-time dashboards
	  - **Oracle Apex:**
	  - **PowerBI**:
	- **Tableau**:
	- 
	
	- **Amazon Redshift**: Enable near-real time with Redshift zero-ETL integrations which easily connects data from streaming services, operational databases, and third-party enterprise applications without building complex data pipeline.
	- **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Utilizes Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) to process large volumes of historical data efficiently and employs micro-batch processing through Spark Streaming, dividing data into small batches for near real-time analysis
	- **Apache Flink**: A stream-first data processing framework, Treats batch processing as a special case of streaming
	- Apache Beam: unified programming model for defining and executing data processing pipelines across various execution engines
	- **Apache Storm**: A real-time computation system designed for processing unbounded data streams with high velocity.
	- **Apache Kafka:** client library for building applications and microservices that process and analyze data
	  
	  

- Different applications and instances of incremental computation
- Papers and instances of the use of the Lambda architecture, how it was done as well as feed back for the implementation
- Notes about ETL and the ETL process as well as implementation in instances
- Differences about how my implementation differs from traditional Lambda Process
-
