##### Project Explanation and Timeline

Limit to around 200 words
- **Brief Description**: A low-code application for generating reports and analysis from a wide range of data sources both in real-time and historical data.
- **Use Case**: Used for manufacturing, transport, logistics etc. for complex systems with distinct components.
- No MVP
- **Design Document**: Completed Project design document, detailing how it would be made and all the necessary components, how it would be deployed, logging, functionality etc.
- **Deployment**: Going to be deployed with GitHub student dev pack on Azure or something
- Not using test data since it doesn't matter too much so just going to use test data to create 2 fake example applications based on use case.
- **Current Process**: I've started to go through and add most of those functionalities but still on the very early stages.
- I've made demo projects for each of the key features since they are so separate and require learning new things, so shouldn't take too long to combine to final project. 
- **Timeline**: Spending most of term 2 on the building of the application and report.
- Finish Gantt Chart and Kanban Board.

##### Questions or clarifications

- **Changes I would make section of report**: Wanted to clarify the limitations of my project and changes that would need to be made 1. If I could do it again but also, how I would do it on a larger scale for enterprise. If that's worth doing or would bog down the initial report.
- **Showcasing Application**: Possible to showcase the application around 2 weeks before project demonstration
- **Using Old Standard of Big Data**: I'm intentionally doing something worse, so doing Lambda instead of Kappa so there's more to learn and write about. Would that be fine, I'm still using modern principles, just for different architecture.
- **Outside topics of Development**: How much/little do I talk about important project stuff but not essential to the point of the report etc. Managing user/data source credentials, the CI/CD Pipeline, Client side Optimisation/compression, Why certain languages are used, etc. would it only be briefly mentioned.
