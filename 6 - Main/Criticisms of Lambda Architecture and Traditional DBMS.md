With a three-tier architecture, it is a big challenge to fulfil service level objectives like maximal response time and minimal throughput rates due to the difficulty in predicting execution times as the low-level layers cannot be correlated well to the high-level layers. Although the typical BI system can give us a forward view of the business, it is well known that traditional BI systems are slow, rigid, time-consuming, and they place a burden on IT
