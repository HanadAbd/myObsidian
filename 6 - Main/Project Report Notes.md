Create a plan for prototype, making the bulk of the application, and making the report. At least a vague timeline.

### Information Sources:

[ACM Digital LibraryLinks](https://dl.acm.org/)
[Google ScholarLinks](https://scholar.google.com/)
[IEEE XploreLinks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)

Quotations and referencing sources aren't necessary for common data, so data that is available in most areas, obvious or derived from other parts of the report.

Figures, Tables, Graphs and Data are the most commonly plagiarised so make sure to include references from another source.

Common pitfalls
- **Omitting Seminal Research**: Read extensively around subject to know what you have or haven't done
- **Misrepresenting the research of others**: Don't make it out to be what it isn't e.g. just reference survey used and not specific references if not familiar with them.
- **Not accurately stating own contributions**: Be honest and precise how much was done, by who and troubles found
- **Focusing on irrelevant aspects of other research**: Focus on important points of research relevant to report. Don't overwhelmed with code and specific implementations of things done.
- **Expecting a reader to be familiar with a particular paper/concept**: Explain key technical ideas without assuming it's already known. 

For literature review, best to break it down by **theme** or **sub-problems**. So recognising literature and systems similar to my own when relevant in the text

Read:
- To identify the research field
- Identify scope of project within that field
- Other solutions in terms of technology, theory, products etc. To further define problems and critical analysis of solutions:
  *Good to know that “X showed Y”, but even better to know that “X showed Y by Z, which means A, B and C for the research being conducted”*
- What is the benefit of research being done? Is it significant, if so, to what and who? Show appreciation for the research field and contribution to show how it's significant.

Characteristics of Academic writing:
- Communicate to it's reader clearly and persuasively. Convincing the reader a lot of thought, effort and research went to the project
- High quality correctness and accuracy
- Clear logical structure, almost telling a story
- Adhere to standard practice of typical structure
- Write precisely and specifically, writing with a clear goal of conveying information

Opening to a paper is typically made up of:
- Title
- Abstract
- Introduction
Typically introduction is 10% - 15% of the total word count

**Project Demonstration**:

- Last's 15 to 20 minutes
- This inspector is marking the final report, so be engaged and thoughtful
- They want to know that I understand what I've done, learned about the field and existing solutions, and what I've done in aid of my goal.
- Plan before hand what topics you want to talk about e.g. **motivation for project, key features, most proud of?**
- General Plan: **Introduction to the problem -> Your idea -> Related solutions -> Demo -> Evaluation**
- You can use 5 slides if necessary, but best to show actual site.

Project Structure:

- **Abstract**: 100- 300 words stating the most important points of the Report
  
- **Introduction**: 10 -15% of the report, Providing content to the report by explaining the relevant background, the problems found and how the project/report will aim to address it.
  
- **Research**: Demonstrating understanding of field and topic area, explaining existing systems similar to my own but how they defer as well as the main systems, practices, theories etc. I will be adhering too.
  
- **Social, Legal Issues**: Brief section going over the legal, social, ethical and professional issues associated with your project.
  
- **Systems Requirements**: Detail what it is I am trying to make and what it should be able to do, making sure to include measurable requirements that can be used for the evaluation. Think Functional and Non-Functional requirements.
  
- **Design**: Breaking it down to a top level architecture or systems architecture, and breaking it down to it's base components and it's functionality and purpose. (Helps with the implementation phase since you carry over the same layout)

- **Implementation**: Discussing how you implemented your design (mentions changes if need be) to meet your expected stated requirements. Brief mentioning's of code with a greater focus on the theory of how things were done. Use similar structure to design
  
- **Testing and Success Measurement**: Document unit testing, integration and systems testing. Might also mention performance, usability, reliability with quantitative measurements to explain how successfully requirements were met. 

- **Project Management**: Timelines for projects, major milestones, tools used to keep track of project and report, software development methodology

- **Evaluation**: Evaluate projects in regards to the requirements created, addressing the overarching challenges with the project in general.

- **Conclusion**:  Summary of project and discussion of possible future work. Perhaps reiterate main points of the project and how it would work in the real world

- **References**: Use a consistent style of referencing and be clear/thorough what and hasn't bee 

Around 8000 - 10000 words for BSC
