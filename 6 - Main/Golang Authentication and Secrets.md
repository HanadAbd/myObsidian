#### **Summary**

I want to learn:

- How to manage credentials both locally and in production
- How to mange **secrets** (e.g. Db credentials, API key for Apache Kafka streams etc.) both locally and in production
- How to scale this management so more can be added, removed, updated and used securely for other services
- Want to learn more about **Session** and **Cookies**
- 



**oAuth0 and how it works**

Authenticating users, and typically used with another middleware to authenticate requests created by users. Username and passwords are sent to a secure IdP (Identity Provider) who, if valid, passes and **access token** and **ID token** in order to state that this user has access
