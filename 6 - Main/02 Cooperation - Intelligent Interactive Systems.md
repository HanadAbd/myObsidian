## Summary

Goes over Cooperation in the context of both humans and AI , in order for Cooperative AI to help humans improve Joint Welfare. It does this through Game theory, the research of cooperative and non-coperative behaviours through the concept of games.

Most of these are done through the lens of cooperation and defection.


### Key qualities and aspects of cooperation:

For these games, key factors include:

- Communicating with other agent via a shared language
- Understanding them and their incentives/history (so things like reputation.)
- Having strategy based on previous information
- Response for defection and cooperation.

### Example Games

- **Prisoner Dilemma**: 
- **Game of Chicken**
- **Hawk/Dove Game**:
- **Stag hunt**:

### Nash Equilibrium

State where no players profit from deviating given the actions of the other player. Deviation only gives no loss or loss, but no profit from perspective of player

### Algorithms for Cooperation:

There are various algorithms for handling deviation and cooperation:

- **Tit for tat**: be cooperative, but be intolerant to defection, but forgive after.
- **Win-stay lose-shift(WSLS)**:  Start coop, and alternate with defection and cooperate with 
- **S# Algorithm**: Operates at human level for these stochastic games by using signals to communicate.

### Types of Experience

Reputation can be gathered in different variations:

- Each interaction is as total strangers e.g. Strangers Market
- You remember each interaction with other e.g. Partners Market
- Each person's interaction history and feedback is visible e.g. feedback market
