#### **What to showcase for demonstration**

- Brief introduction of myself, what I am making (An application that query any data in a timely, efficient and low latency manner) and why I am making (explanation of what i did during placement)
- Explanation of the Lambda architecture and how it works
- Demo of the test data page as well as it's necessity, so demonstrating data being created
- Demo of actual report page reacting to the change being made to test data
- Explanation of the pipeline approach and how it works
- Explanation of how queries work and a demonstration of that
- `Explanation of how server sharding was attempted, by generating each server as it's own separate thread with allocations associated with it, as well as managing resources and fault handling `
- Explain how it was deployed not in a ideal way
- Explanation of how paper would be divided into, so both explaining project but key sections outlining limitations, how it would be used 

Things to consider:

- Might ask for how it's used so creating new workspace, assigning prod database (state how I'm using one on azure)
- Might ask to see code so should be available
- Might ask to see deployed version including CI/CD
- Might ask to see queries
- Might ask to see how new/reports are made
