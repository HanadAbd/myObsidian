**A Proposed Intelligent Interactive System for Fact Checking and Moderating LLM Output**

## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have drastically changed the manner in which we create and interact with written content. Although incredibly fluent, such models tend to produce factually inaccurate information and possess embedded prejudices based on their historical imbalances in training material. This literature review proposes an intelligent interactive system that can verify factual assertions when assessing the representation of multiple perspectives. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), advanced prompt engineering, and a dedicated bias-assessment module, the system aims to enhance the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of LLM responses. Through this, it not only counters disinformation but also promotes ethical AI practice that aligns with future regulatory trends, such as the EU AI Act

## Problem Statement

The growing integration of LLMs across various domains—from education and journalism to policymaking—has unveiled a critical vulnerability: the potential for widespread misinformation coupled with inherent bias. LLMs are known to “hallucinate,” meaning they generate outputs that, while coherent and plausible, are factually incorrect. For example, even with advances in model design, state-of-the-art LLMs continue to produce erroneous content that can mislead users and skew public understanding (TruthfulQA, 2021). This is further compounded by the fact that these models learn from vast amounts of historical data, which inherently embed social and cultural prejudices.

As detailed in “Fairness and Bias in Intelligent Interactive Systems” [1], many sources argue that the root cause of bias in LLM outputs is the training data itself. Since these models are trained on centuries’ worth of text, they replicate dominant historical narratives—often favoring Western perspectives. Navigli et al. (2023) [1] demonstrated that when queried for stereotypes, different models such as GPT and Bloom tend to associate positive attributes (e.g., “freedom”) predominantly with Western cultures, while non-Western perspectives are marginalized. This phenomenon is not isolated; research by Abid et al. (2021) [3] reveals that prompts related to “Islam” frequently yield responses laden with negative and violent connotations, perpetuating an anti-Muslim bias.

Gender bias is also a persistent issue. Kotek et al. (2023) [4] found that LLMs tend to reinforce traditional gender stereotypes by assigning women to nurturing or administrative roles while reserving technical or leadership roles for men. Such imbalances are a direct consequence of training data that is historically skewed by Western, male-centric narratives. Moreover, the single-answer paradigm prevalent in current LLM designs exacerbates these problems. Instead of offering a spectrum of perspectives, LLMs typically provide one or two definitive answers to complex queries. This reductionist approach, highlighted in various studies on fairness and bias in intelligent interactive systems [1], inadvertently reinforces societal hierarchies and historical inaccuracies.

Incorporating insights from the provided literature review on fairness and bias, it becomes evident that the training data—rich in historical prejudice—drives these biases. The review [1] outlines that despite attempts at mitigating bias (for instance, through prompt engineering or the use of external references), LLMs still mirror societal inequities. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an intelligent system that not only verifies factual accuracy but also systematically integrates diverse viewpoints, ensuring that users receive comprehensive and balanced information.

## Proposed Solution

To address these multifaceted challenges, the proposed intelligent interactive system combines rigorous fact-checking with an in-depth bias-assessment framework. At its core, the system employs a transformer-based LLM augmented by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. When a user submits a query, the system first uses advanced prompt engineering to refine the question context, ensuring that all nuances of the user’s intent are captured accurately. It then accesses external authoritative databases—including academic journals, trusted news repositories, and government publications—to retrieve corroborative evidence. This retrieved data is merged with the LLM’s response, anchoring the output in verifiable sources and significantly reducing the risk of hallucinations.

Central to the system’s innovation is the bias-assessment module. This component is designed to quantitatively evaluate the “bias score” of each response by analyzing the distribution of perspectives against a curated reference of balanced viewpoints. Research by Chu et al. (2024) [2] supports the need for such a measure, noting that LLM outputs often reflect imbalances due to uneven representation in training datasets. For example, if a response overemphasizes Western narratives or overly relies on traditional gender roles, the module flags these as potential biases, prompting further verification.

The technical design of the system is based on a modular architecture. Separate modules are responsible for fact verification, bias assessment, and user feedback integration. The user interface is designed to present not only the final answer but also auxiliary information such as a bias score indicator and a detailed breakdown of the supporting evidence. This layered presentation enhances transparency and builds trust, as users can see exactly how the answer was generated and which sources were used. In addition, the system incorporates a dynamic feedback loop; users can flag discrepancies or request further clarifications, and this feedback is continuously used to refine the verification algorithms and update the evidence corpus. This iterative process ensures that the system evolves alongside changing societal norms and emerging data trends.

Practical frameworks described by Salminen et al. (2024) [5] and Leiser et al. (2024) [7] provide concrete examples of integrating verification tools—such as HILL, a hallucination identifier that cross-checks outputs against authenticated sources. By leveraging these techniques, the proposed system minimizes the propagation of false information and improves the interpretability of LLM outputs. Users are thus provided with a clear view of the underlying evidence supporting each claim, reinforcing the overall credibility of the system.

In summary, the proposed solution is a unified system that enhances both factual accuracy and the balanced presentation of multiple perspectives. By integrating state-of-the-art verification and bias assessment techniques, the system aims to foster a more trustworthy and equitable digital environment—one in which users can rely on AI-generated content to be both accurate and representative of diverse viewpoints.

## Risk Assessment

While the proposed system represents a significant advancement in mitigating the shortcomings of current LLMs, several risks remain. The probabilistic nature of LLMs implies that, despite robust external verification, occasional hallucinations may still occur—especially if the external databases provide outdated or biased information. Additionally, integrating multiple verification modules increases system complexity, which may result in higher response times or technical integration challenges that could negatively affect the user experience.

Another critical risk is the potential for adversarial attacks. Malicious users could attempt prompt injection attacks or design queries specifically intended to bypass the verification processes, thereby compromising the system’s integrity. Furthermore, operational challenges may arise when handling highly ambiguous or multifaceted queries. Although the system’s modular design facilitates continuous updates, ensuring that all components consistently deliver accurate and unbiased results will require persistent oversight, regular audits, and strict adherence to ethical guidelines, such as those proposed in the EU AI Act [6].

There is also a risk that the bias-assessment module might misinterpret subtle cultural nuances or overcorrect by flagging legitimate variations as biases. Such overcorrections could lead to a dilution of authentic voices in favor of a homogenized output. Consequently, while the system offers promising strategies to mitigate misinformation and bias, its ongoing success will depend on continuous refinement and rigorous quality assurance protocols.

## Societal Impact

If successfully implemented, this intelligent interactive system could play a transformative role in mitigating the adverse effects of biased and inaccurate LLM outputs. By systematically verifying facts and transparently assessing bias, the system would empower users across various sectors—such as journalism, education, and public policy—to make more informed decisions. Enhanced transparency in AI-generated content could foster greater trust among users and contribute to a more balanced public discourse.

From a societal perspective, the system’s ability to display multiple perspectives on complex issues is particularly important. It would counteract the reinforcement of traditional stereotypes and historical inaccuracies by showcasing a broader range of cultural narratives and viewpoints. This inclusive approach can help bridge gaps in understanding and promote social equity. Furthermore, compliance with emerging legal frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, would ensure that the system remains aligned with evolving regulatory standards, thereby enhancing its credibility and acceptance among diverse communities.

Ultimately, by mitigating misinformation and bias, the proposed system could set new benchmarks for ethical AI deployment. It would serve as a model for integrating technological innovation with social responsibility, fostering a more informed and equitable society.
