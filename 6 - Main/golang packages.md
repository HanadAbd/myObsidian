Packages per Directory
--

You can only have 1 package per subdirectory, so usually a lot of main in the main folder. And other packages in other sub directories

Using Packages across Project
--

You define the package name on the highest level
```
package main
package 
```


Private and Public Elements
--
Use Uppercase and Lowercase to specify public and private functions and variables.
Only Uppercase elements can be shared across
