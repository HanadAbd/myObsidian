***Rough Notes While Reading***

**Introduction** goes over the importance of the Quran, discussing how it effected the first people who read it as well as those who have read it since. It describes how ordinary individuals at the time, "grazed sheep, herded camel's and traded petty merchandise became the leaders of mankind", when learning the words of the Quran. How over the 23 years the prophet Muhammed PBUH was slowly revealed more ayaas and surahs, to build a final collection of the words of God. 

It goes in to great detail of the personnal effect of the quram, in how it defines your mission on earth in order to serve allah. A powerful ends, the introduction, describing some individual, overwhelmed and frightened by realtiy of their life, or more likely life it self. It contiunes and ends with a declaration of simple love for Allah and desire to be closer. How a love for Allah keeps him fufilled andd complete without being overwhelmed by the world.

**Editor's note** then proceeds to discuss some bsiic facts regarding book, such as basic informtation regarding the quran. How it was revealed over 23 years in bits and pieces by archangel gibriel, that it is not in order of revelartion and the 2 periods it wwas revealed in relation to muslim migration from makkah to medinah. Ayaa's revealed before (**Makkan**) typically correspond to the time, with more wider understanidng and fondations of islam explored in the earlier days, and later (**Madinnan**) in medinah, more about rules and regulartions to define how muslim communtitires should live. 

This means the quran might not provide full context of the prophet and time written, since it waws revealed to those who may have already knwon him.

## Surah Al-Fatiyah (The Opening)

Surah Al-Fatiyah was the first **complete** surah to be revealed to the prophet is the start of the quran itself. It's a prayer/ almost contract defining the readers relationship with Allah. They not only announce God as being but refer to him as "Al-Raheem" or a being of extreme contious mercy. We confirm worship done is for him, and him alone and ask he helps stay on the right path to not envoke his anger, but to simply worship him.

For this reason, the editor doesn't refer to the surah as an introdduction but more of a request and answer. Those who read the surah and make an honest attempt to understand the allah, will have the rest of the quaran as the answer to explain to them.

An Of course, this is a mandatory surah to be read in the first rakat, of prayer, not only highlighting how important it is, but that the surah is a confirmation of love and seeking guidance.


## Surah Al-Baqarah. 1 - 141 (The Cow)
