Due to limitation of finding a focus group that have type 1 diabetes, we instead tried finding user data from a multitude of places. Those being:
1. Few friends and family of those we do know have type diabetes type 1
2. Online experiences found both in product reviews and forum, going over their own experience
3. Research done by other companies and scientists for researching those with diabetes and insulin usage

We've collected data from each and where relevant we'll provide quotes and diagrams going over what we've learnt over this process

**Q1. Current Insulin Storage Practices**

1. How do you currently store your insulin when you're at home?
   The best place to keep the insulin you're not using is in the fridge. This is because insulin needs to be kept at temperatures lower than 25°C (77°F). The ideal storage temperature is 2 to 6°C (36 to 43°F).  For the insulin you've opened and are currently using, room temperature is usually fine.- [diabetes.org.uk](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about-diabetes/looking-after-diabetes/treatments/insulin/what-is-insulin#:~:text=Storing%20insulin&text=The%20best%20place%20to%20keep,room%20temperature%20is%20usually%20fine.)
2. What methods do you use to keep insulin cool when traveling or away from home?
3. Have you ever experienced insulin becoming ineffective due to improper storage temperature?
4. How often do you need to transport insulin outside your home?

**Q2. Portability and Usage**

1. How long do you typically need to keep insulin cool when away from home?
2. Where do you usually carry your diabetes supplies (e.g., bag, purse, backpack)?
3. Would you prefer a device that can hold multiple insulin vials/pens or just one?
4. What concerns do you have about current cooling devices?

**Q3. Affordability and Perceived Value**

1. How often do you currently replace your insulin due to temperature-related issues?
2. What additional features would be useful? (e.g., built-in temperature log, smartphone connectivity)
3. How important is having a backup power option?
4. How much would you be willing to spend on a portable insulin cooling solution?

**Q4. Open-Ended Exploratory Questions**

1. What would your ideal portable insulin cooling device look like?
2. What type of insulin do you use? (e.g., vials, pens, pump)
3. Can you describe the most difficult situation you've encountered with insulin storage and how you handled it?
4. What worries you most about keeping your insulin at the right temperature?
   **Dr. Cook:** Not only do they have to worry about their health, they also have to worry about the impact of hot weather on their equipment, their medications, and their supplies ... Many times, patients lose the ability to cool themselves in the heat. - [mayoclinic.org](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/multimedia/vid-20078274#:~:text=Not%20only%20do%20they%20have%20to%20worry%20about%20their%20health%2C%20they%20also%20have%20to%20worry%20about%20the%20impact%20of%20hot%20weather%20on%20their%20equipment%2C%20their%20medications%2C%20and%20their%20supplies.)
