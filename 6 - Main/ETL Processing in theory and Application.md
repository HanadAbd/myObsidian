*Next Generation Business Intelligence and Analytics*

Todayâ€™s enterprises use an extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) model to extract data, perform transformations, and load the transformed data into the data warehouse. This model relies on two types of processes which are vital to business operations: online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP). OLTP is used to manage business processes, such as order processing, while OLAP is used to support strategic decision making, such as sales analytics

OLAP workloads perform mostly read-only operations on large amounts of business data updated by OLTP workloads

ETL processes are the backbone component of a data warehouse, since they supply the data warehouse with the necessary integrated and reconciled data from heterogeneous and distributed data sources.

_The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Definitive Guide to Dimensional Modeling, 3rd Edition_

"ETL systems are responsible for the extraction of data from numerous source systems, enforcing data quality and consistency standards, conforming data so that separate sources can be used together, and finally delivering data in a presentation-ready format so that application developers can build applications and end users can make decisions. These processes are difficult to build because they involve almost every possible exception condition due to the wide variety of source systems. In many cases, the source data systems aren't well documented and have accumulated the debris of many generations of systems development." (The Data Warehouse Toolkit)

_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_

"An ETL process extracts data from a source database by issuing queries, transforms the data to match the destination schema, and load the data into the destination database. In a traditional data warehouse, the transformation step is typically the most complex... Recent approaches like ELT (extract, load, transform) have inverted this pattern, loading raw data first and then transforming it within the destination database." The book notes that "one of the most crucial design decisions for a data warehouse is the schema layout, with star schemas predominating due to their balance of clarity and query performance." (Designing Data-Intensive Applications)

_What's the Difference? Incremental Processing with Change Queries in Snowflake_

"Traditional ETL processing requires full reprocessing of datasets, which becomes increasingly resource-intensive as data volumes grow. Incremental approaches that process only new or changed data offer significant efficiency improvements. Our implementation of CHANGES queries and STREAMs enables incremental processing patterns that reduce processing costs by up to 95% while maintaining data freshness requirements." The paper highlights how "modern cloud data platforms have revolutionized traditional ETL processes by supporting ELT patterns that leverage the scalable compute resources of the data platform itself." (What's the Difference? Incremental Processing with Change Queries in Snowflake)

_dbt documentation_

"dbt (data build tool) fundamentally changes how data teams work together by enabling analysts to produce trusted datasets for reporting, machine learning and analytics using software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. dbt enables teams to deploy analytics code using a process that looks much more like software development. This represents a shift from traditional ETL to ELT patterns where data is first loaded into the destination and then transformed in place." The documentation emphasizes that "dbt is the T in ELT. It doesn't extract or load data, but it's extremely good at transforming data that's already loaded into your warehouse." (dbt)

_Evolution of Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes towards data product pipelines_

"This paper examines the transition from traditional batch ETL processes to modern data product pipelines driven by rising data volumes, increased demand for real-time analytics, and evolving cloud-native architectures. We outline how ETL processes have evolved from monolithic overnight batch jobs to stream-based, event-driven pipelines that treat analytical datasets as products with clear ownership, quality guarantees, and metadata." The research notes that "data mesh architectures represent the latest evolution, organizing analytical data assets as domain-owned products rather than technology-centric platforms." (Evolution of Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes towards data product pipelines)

_A model-driven framework for ETL process development_

"ETL processes extract data from various sources, transform them according to business needs, and load them into data warehouses. These processes constitute up to 70% of data warehousing project resources and are critical to ensuring data quality and consistency. Our model-driven approach provides a vendor-independent specification methodology and automatic code generation for commercial platforms, addressing the lack of standardization in ETL development." The paper highlights that "effective ETL design requires balancing performance, maintainability, reliability and metadata management considerations." (A model-driven framework for ETL process development)

_Foreign Keys Open the Door for Faster Incremental View Maintenance_

"Incremental view maintenance (IVM) minimizes the time needed to bring a materialized view up-to-date. It allows the refresh of a materialized view solely based on the base table changes since the last refresh. In serverless cloud-based warehouses, IVM uses computations defined as SQL scripts that update the materialized view based on updates to its base tables." The research demonstrates how "incorporating knowledge about foreign keys into IVM can significantly speed up its performance by reducing the scope of data that must be processed during refreshes." (Foreign Keys Open the Door for Faster Incremental View Maintenance)

_Comparative study of data warehouses modeling approaches: Inmon, Kimball and Data Vault_

"This comparative analysis examines three major data warehouse modeling methodologies: Inmon's enterprise data warehouse approach, Kimball's dimensional modeling, and Data Vault architecture. Inmon advocates for a normalized enterprise model with departmental data marts, while Kimball promotes dimensional models organized by business processes. Data Vault offers a hybrid approach designed for flexibility and auditability." The study concludes that "each methodology has distinct advantages for different organizational contexts - Inmon for enterprise-wide integration, Kimball for business-friendly query performance, and Data Vault for highly changeable environments requiring complete data lineage."

**How does ETL Processing Work and it's function and history?

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) serves as the foundational process for moving data from operational systems into analytics environments. It emerged in the early 1990s alongside the data warehouse concept, addressing the need to consolidate information from disparate systems.

"A model-driven framework for ETL process development" describes ETL as "the backbone component of a data warehouse, since they supply the data warehouse with the necessary integrated and reconciled data from heterogeneous and distributed data sources." The process begins by extracting data from source systems, applying transformations to standardize formats and enforce business rules, then loading the results into a destination system.**


**Difference between Data ware houses and traditional databases used in RDBMS?**

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) is the typical approach used for Databases idata an business, containing business data and events.*Next Generation Business Intelligence and Analytics* In order to support analytics, which would require large, constant and various types of aggregation of data, Online Analytical Transaction Processing (OLAP), is typically used. Typically being, a read only view of large amounts of OLTP data, designed to allow business analysts query as effectively as possible

Data warehouses and traditional RDBMS serve fundamentally different purposes, reflected in their design and optimization choices. Traditional databases support Online Transaction Processing (OLTP), managing daily business operations through high-volume write operations with strict data integrity.

"Next Generation Business Intelligence and Analytics" explains that "OLTP is used to manage business processes, such as order processing," focusing on current operational state. These systems typically employ normalized schemas (3NF) to minimize redundancy for transactional efficiency.

In contrast, data warehouses support Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) for strategic decision-making. They "perform mostly read-only operations on large amounts of business data updated by OLTP workloads" ("Next Generation Business Intelligence and Analytics"), optimizing for complex analytical queries rather than transaction throughput.

Data warehouses often use dimensional models (star or snowflake schemas) that intentionally denormalize data for query performance. As "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" notes, "one of the most crucial design decisions for a data warehouse is the schema layout, with star schemas predominating due to their balance of clarity and query performance."

**Current implementation/storage solutions and version of Data ware houses and Data lakes**

  Modern data storage has evolved dramatically with cloud technologies reshaping implementation approaches. Cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Azure Synapse Analytics have become predominant, offering scalable resources without physical infrastructure management. These platforms separate storage from compute, allowing independent scaling of each component.

"What's the Difference? Incremental Processing with Change Queries in Snowflake" notes how "modern cloud data platforms have revolutionized traditional ETL processes by supporting ELT patterns that leverage the scalable compute resources of the data platform itself."

Data lakes provide complementary capabilities, storing raw, unprocessed data in native formats on platforms like Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, and Google Cloud Storage, with processing via frameworks like Apache Spark, Presto, and Databricks. This approach maximizes flexibility while requiring more technical expertise.

The emerging lakehouse architecture attempts to combine both paradigms. Solutions like Delta Lake, Lake Formation, and open-source projects like Apache Iceberg add data warehouse-like features to data lakes, supporting both structured analytics and data science within a unified platform.

**How pipelines are written and made including requirements and implementations done?**

Modern transformation approaches increasingly leverage SQL within the data warehouse itself. "dbt documentation" explains how tools like dbt enable "analysts to produce trusted datasets using software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation."

Robust pipelines include comprehensive error handling, logging, alerting, and recovery mechanisms. Performance optimization techniques include incremental processing, partitioning, and parallelization, which "What's the Difference? Incremental Processing with Change Queries in Snowflake" notes can reduce "processing costs by up to 95%."



**How modern pipelines are managed and done?(DB, or cloud solutions)**

**Current State of the ETL Process, if it's still used, current similar approaches used instead (e.g. using data lake which is unstrcutred, etc.)**

**Examples of use cases of data warehouses and etl processing in enterprise**
