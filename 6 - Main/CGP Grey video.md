Summary: 

7 different steps that cause misery in order of severity

##### **Main points**:
- Sleep by 22:00 and wake by 6:00 with phone turned off during that duration.
- Can only watch for as long as I've read or drawn
- 4 hours of work followed by break 
- 08:00 - 18:00 days
- Days on: Sun, Mon, Tue, Thu, Fri
- Days off: Wed, Sat
- Each overall goal should be SMART and have  specific time restricted and necessary atomic sub tasks building to the final goal

 **Follow your instincts:**

Naturally, most things you want to do will be immediately gratifying even if it's something you'll know you regret. But that also means you're constantly conscious on other options that could be done.

Especially if you constantly wait for motivation that will come at undetermined "right" time.

*Key Takeaways: If you're conscious of an issue see if that issue is fixable, and discuss plans on how to do it*

**Stillness or staying in the same location in general

Limited movement and exercise through out the day combined with staying in 1 dark location, where focus and play occur at the same time, makes it incredibly hard to do either.

*Key Takeaways: Take regular breaks and go outside each day. Best we can do is walk around, so have it be every 4 hours of work, walk around*

**Insomnia and inconsistent sleeping schedule:**

An unfixed sleep schedule will cause lot's of tiredness, inconsistency with getting to UNI at studying times or when to enjoy certain things. Tiredness especially is a big factor since I might not do anything the whole day

*Key Takeaways: Bed at 10:00 and wake at 6:00 Turn off phone so alarms still go off but can't use it. Leave house by 7:00*

**Minimise Screen time throughout the day:**

Staring at a screen all day, from night to to early morning distract your brains and is far too over simulating. Especially difficult since it's always available during doing work so distancing yourself where possible is ideal.

*Key Takeaways: Can only use social media for as long as having read or drawn that day. Can check screen time on phone*

**Stay up to date with things you have 0 control over:**

Don't think I can interact with media or news to do with working in a healthy productive way. If I'm actively looking at it, then sure, but otherwise


**VAPID goals as opposed to SMART Goals:**
   (Vague, Amorphous (unclearly defined), Pie in the sky, Irrelevant Delayed)

Unclear goals with unspecified times and priority which are far too abstract and difficult to do will just make things more daunting.

*Key Takeaways: Better to have specific atomic goals that add up to the final goal, adding time restrictions for those atomic tasks.*
