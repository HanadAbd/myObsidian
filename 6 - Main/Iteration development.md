Water bottle with just heat sink and fan with additional compartment for diabetic kit items

+Plenty of space
+Portable
+Discrete
+Affordable

-Perhaps too large
-Dependent on other items.
-Inefficient Cooling



#### Development 2

+Secure clamps/slots for pens
+Openable compartment for pens
+Small efficient Screen
+Fully functional cooling and removal heat solution
+Slot for optional cooling Gel pack  
+Side compartment for other element of diabetic test kit
-Only works for fixed size and thickness pens
-Far too thick with the added side compartment
-Heating solution far too close to battery
-Vents are too close to hands
-Only 1 vent. Needs an inlet and outlet for successful airflow
-No motor for fan/ device too small for fully functioning solution.

#### Development 3


-no motor


#### Development 4

A pocket sized device with fully functioning cooling that contains a lid with a hole to place pens or vials, next to it is the cooling layer and Heat sink with it's corresponding fan. Pens stick out of the component to be picked out. Doesn't have any of the same problems as development 2.
