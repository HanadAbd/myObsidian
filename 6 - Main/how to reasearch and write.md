**Summary:**

Going over the process of how I'm going to research and write.

1. Keep track of references in *Zotero Reference Manager*
2. Build an excel list, that stores : **Name**, **Link**, **Author**/**journal Information**, as well As key notes ("can be copy and pasted from abstract with some little changes from you")
3. Take notes as reading (so make an obsidian note for that source, with that title). Try to write as little as possible and just copy over as much as you can and leave write up for later if you want to include it.
4. When Writing notes in own words, add in bold the name of the source being used, instead of just [1] or something.

**Advice for writing**:
- **Demonstrate Deep Understanding**: To demonstrate a deep understanding, avoid 1:1 relation of Research to point/evidence extracted.
  For example, you might say “Research in [X] was a significant step forward.” but it’d be much better to say, “Research in [X] was a significant step forward because X and Y, though it did not address an important aspect of Z.”.
  So 1 report "relationship" to multiple points or multiple reports aiding a same points.
- **Critical Reading via Questions**: Gain greater insight from research by asking questions, as opposed to simply extracting data. Questions like: 
	- What is the point of this source?
	- Why was it written?
	- What is the wider points/themes/ideas this relates too?
	- How would it relate to your wider point? (It can be more nuanced then agree/disagree e.g. explores consequence of point, disagrees with aspects, segue to another point)
	- Has the context changed since it was written?
	- How does the source come to this point?
- **Broad to Specific:** Start more general earlier on to introduce the field of research and problem, and hone down to discussing key ideas of the paper as well as more critical analysis.
