MY STORIES WITH ATHEISTS THE DOUBTFUL & OVER-THINKERS WITH APPROACHES TO CONVINCING & GUIDING THEM
by Shaykh Ahmad Al-Tayyar

## Summary

Story of an Imam/teacher discussing with a doubtful but knowledgeable student. He explores fundamental questions to explain why is Islam is the only viable option, and prophet Muhammed (PBUH) is the final messenger. They briefly discuss some basic theology, science in the Quran as well questions as to why Allah has chosen to do certain things.

## Key points Arguments

### Nature vs Creator

*"Is nature created or the creator?‚Äù (pg 11)* fsdf

### Necessity of messengers

### Relativism vs Absolutism

Bit strange,  but Shaykh Ahmad, argues for both depending on context. When asked, why *"He [Allah] brings a new law and abrogates the previous one" (pg 12)*, hinting at previous laws needing fixing and 1 messenger not being good enough.

He argues the need for additions based on the time e.g. No longer being allowing brother and sister to marry although that was necessary during the time of Adam. He argues that *"universal principles"* have been persevered, such as belief in Allah and the foundations in faith, regardless of time.

So Relativism for the time of additions and new prophets, but since then, Absolutism. So technically any innovations,  or even wants for innovation are unethical and unnecessary.

This doesn't make too much sense, since it implies nothing new has happened to require new messengers or texts to confirm what we should be doing. He even laterally argues, how it would be selfish not provide new experts and manuals for new *"phones"* or in his allegory, new rulings and teachings.


Things to check:

- Destruction of Idols
- LGBTQ and sexuality
- Polygamy
- Slavery
- Passive Reponses to Drug and Alcohol
-
