IP protocol is a sequenced ,unreliable but also easy to implement  protocol used to send across multiple interconnected networks **inter**net, by sending datagrams with a destination address.

### Problems with IP

When a packet is lost, either no error message is generated or error message has same unreliability. Also, no checksum for data, to verify corruption, relying on upper layer to verify.

Packets can be lost, delivered out of order, or damaged with no means to detect it.

IPv4 Datagram Description
--
The header is comprised of 32 bit layers that are 16 bit aligned, not byte aligned.
Typically options are optional so only 5 words/20 bytes.

Key details are:

- **Options** are no longer really used so not mentioning.
- **Version** is IP version (4 in this case)
- **IHL** is the length of the header (normally 5)
- **Type of Service** is used for security labels (SECRET, TOPSECRET), precedence and quality of service, other no longer typically used
- **Total length** (measured bytes, not units like IHL)
- **Identification** is a 16bit id used identify fragments
- **Flags and Fragments** is used to split packets into fragments to correspond to maximum package size
- **Time to live** is typically the amount of hops a packet is valid for, usually decremented with each hop. Recommended value is 64 for the internet.
- **Protocol Numbers** defines higher level protocol used e.g. 6 is UDP, 17 is UDP or 1 wh ich is ICMP which provides detail about error messages e.g. hop count exceeded , or destination unreachable
- **Header checksum** (which is insecure and can be recalculated  after changing byte in header and using old checksum but still good for noticing accidental corruption)
- **Source and Destination addresses**, used for identifying hosts and from/to it's going

Brief Fragmentation Explanation:
--

If you have a package too large for a link, larger then the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU, largest amount of data for 1 packet in a network), you can use fragmentation. Split it into multiple packets with a **MF flag** (more fragments) = 1 and same ID, with the last packet setting MF=0. Also, change the fragment offset, to the offset in bytes in the original packet of this fragment's payload. These fragments are only reassembled by the **destination system**, which waits until it has the full set before processing them.

They aren't preferred due to being more inefficient due to requiring end to end transmission for any lost packets, and IPv6 ignores fragmentation all together.

Modern fix is discovering minimum MTU route ==with Path MTU Discovery== by testing the route, periodically sending a packet of MF=1 until "fragmentation needed" error is returned, sending smaller packets until it's successful.


IPv4 32 Bit notation:
--
So 32 bits split into 4 bytes which is written as 4 decimal numbers separated by "." without the leading 0's e.g. 192.1.1.12


The left part is network and the rest, host information.

This can be calculated with:
- **Class A:** If it starts with bit 0 so 0..127, 8 bits identify network, rest host (For ==Large companies, universities and companies==)  
- **Class B:** If it starts with bits 10 so 128..191, 16 bits each ==(For Smaller universities and companies)==
- **Class C:** If it starts with bits 110, so 192..223, first 24 bits for network, rest host.

==Class A and B very sparsely occupied, with 1 class A havin 2^24 or 16 million hosts, which couldn't possibly be satisfied by universities== 

==It used to be 32bit due to small 64Kb routing tables which is now laughably not an issue== 

**![[Pasted image 20250109124030.webp]]**
These different divisions are broken in to different classes with higher classes costing more, due to having more host spaces. A practice called **subnetting** was used essentially breaking down their higher classes like class A into 256 Class B's just to have more possible networks, an everybody internally would have an agreed upon understanding that this is happening.

**Netmasks** are also used to signify how many bits at the beginning are for network e.g. /8 for Class A. Defining how much is network, and how much is host e.g. (255.0.0.0 instead of /8).

**Supernetting**, was the act of grouping contagious classes to make routing tables mor compact e.g. 8 former Class C's  (/24) could be placed together under /21. Obsolete now though.


==Subnets  no longer need to be byte divisions, allowing for netmasks e.g. /28==

IPv6:
---

128 bits long to over come Ipv4 limit of only `2^32` possible addresses, although minimum Ipv6 allocation is /64, making it effectively 64 bit when it comes to available address space. The first 64 bits are used for the network.

Header is Subset of IPv4, with the additional of *flow label*.

- **Version** = 6
- **Traffic Class**
- **Flow Label** - Labelling related flows of data, idea being routers keep related flows on same route, reducing reordering and jittering(variation in latency) 
- **Payload Length**: Length of remaining Data
- **Next Header** -  Type of the next header, (equivalent to IPv4 Protocol field).
- **Hop Limit** - Same as TTL in IPv4

Flow classifiers and labels are debatable, since although you could use the 20 bits to mark "related" traffic,  to process in best way, you could just look at the TCP header

IPv6 Notation
--
Hex string, broken into 16 bit chunks with colon and leading 0's supressed. e.g.
- 2001:8b0:129f:a90f:60c:ceff:fedd:f68

:: means as many 0's as will fit e.g. 2001::ff = 2001:0:0:0:0:0:0:ff

Benefits of IPv6
--
- Every service on a device can be given it's own address without being dependent on the IP of another, making it easier to migrate across machine.
- We can assign a separate global IP address to every device in a building

IP in practice
--

If packet is meant for this network, it's already where it's meant to be. Otherwise Look through routing table which contains a list of next hop locations, looking for the **longest matching mask** until the packet is at that network. At any point the the package get's damaged, it is dropped.

And with each second(rare) but mainly each hop, the TTL is deprecated, where when it hits 0, packet is discarded, and an error report  (“ICMP Time Exceeded”) is generated. Prevents packets circulating endlessly. For IPV4, it's header checksum would be need to be recomputed.

IP over ethernet, involves finding the MAC address of the desired location, which for IPv4, you must use **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol), asking "who has this", where as ==for IPv6 the "**Neighbour discovery Protocol**" which works the same with with ICMPv6 messages 135 (solicitation) and 136 (advertisement)==. Of course, this is only if it's point to multi-point, if point to point packet is just sent down.


### Full Method for routing

Each networking router maintains it's own routing table for the next potential hops. On the local network, IP uses ARP to send packet to local network's gateway in order to hop next network that chares the longest match mask. Does this continously until finding correct network. If found network is on ethernet, MAC address is found either using ARP for IPv4 or Neighbour Discovery Protocol, with IPv6.


### ==Recomputation of Checksum==

==Breif point, but in the case of the decrementing TTL, fast algorithms are used to recompute it based on knowing what has changed. IPv6 doesn't have checksum and relys on lower layer being reliable.==
