# Current issues with slide deck V2

- Using AI for user data is a bit strange and not entirely useful
- Final idea in slide 4 is a bit too complete, so it makes it look like the final idea came first
- Should have a more detailed specification of what the final result of our research was. Slide 28 is good, but having a more fleshed out text saying what we're making would be nice.
  
  What i mean is, defining functional/non-functional requirements as well as project scope ("What this product can't help with like isn't intended for those that require constant insulin throughout the day")
  
  "We are making a portable insulin that needs to be able to do this in these conditions. Should be able to stored safetly in these areas."


1. Clarity and ease of understanding - Very good
   
2. User Centred Design stages - Pretty good but could justify each later step better
   
3. Data gathering -  Not a fan of this. Questionnaire is fine but probably should include more information about the person to see how relevant this product is for them, to get a better idea for who this is for? Obviously these people freeze insulin at home, 
   
   "Type of diabetes"
   "How many times a day do require some data insulin doseage"
   
   Also, for questions like "How often do you", "How long do you", could benefit with a scope of answers. Like scale from 1 to 5 or how many times a day once, twice, more then 5 etc.
   
   Could include answers from family/friends as well as responses and stories from product reviews or data gathered by other refigerated insulin companies.
   
   Again having a more fleshed out design and what we learnt would be nice. Must weigh this amount, fit in cup holders, should work for this long. Should be able to with stand bright and hot environments exceeding 30 degrees etc. Around 800g to be light enough for elderly people. Don't want to spend more the Â£100
   
4. How data influenced design - N/A but again, having a more detailed specification of what we want to make will inevitably structure the design. Also literally showing the changing or narrowing of our ideas based on the UCD process is again very helpful
   
5. How good the slide deck is overall - Pretty Good
   
   
6. Solution and how good it is at solving the problems defined - N/A
   
7. Clear understanding of the chosen area - I think this nice but could use more information about units, types of diabetes, usage throughout the day. Specifically what type of people with diabetes type 1 and 2 are we trying to help 
   
8. Critique and justification of solution- N/A
9. Project Planning and group planning - We already added a week break down but could worth adding, who made what persona, who came up with what idea. Literally adding the weekly plan Shahill made himself to the Slide Deck. That would be nice.
10. Poster - N/A

Thanks for coming.
Main thing is some deigns for Tuesday based on the qualities on slide 28 

Points from meeting:


- Forgot to talk about storyboard. Will probably just include images of people of how people store it, leave it to thaw etc. I won't do one for every persona because that seems overkill we can add more later if need be. -For Hanad
- Instead of saying we got AI to be our survey participant, We can keep the final summary, but asking Actual people (fake but still) or product reviews to get a better idea. (I can provide this some point this week).
- Could expand user data to explore and diabetes/insulin usage (Honestly don't think this is useful, but it is proving understanding of domain and user's which is it's own section in the mark scheme so might as well add it) - For Hanad
- Adding Scopes to questions in the questionnaire (e.g. for "How long", give a range of answers" - For Shahill
- Final idea on slide 4 is a bit too specific. It'd be nice to show it being vague initially and then fleshing it out after the empathising stage. Maybe for after slide 28. (I can provide this some point this week). We can use it as a criteria - For Shahill and Hanad
- Worth adding our weekly plan at the beginning of the slide as well as saying who wrote what persona/sketch. - For Shahill
