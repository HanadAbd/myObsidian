*Business Intelligence Based on Big Data in Innovative E-commerce Data Li Tang*

The results indicate that the application of business intelligence based on big data (BD) in innovative EC (e-commerce) data analysis can effectively improve processing efficiency (Max: 92%) and analysis depth (Max: 9.8 points) in data analysis.

By using these technologies and tools, companies can collect, analyse, and leverage massive amounts of data to gain deeper insights and decision-making support. The update of this kind of technology and tools requires enterprises to invest funds and resources, and carry out systematic planning and implementation.

Data mining refers to the process of automatically discovering potential relationships or patterns from a large amount of data and making predictions, decisions, and controls

Usually, a data warehouse consists of three parts: overall enterprise data, business data, and business activities

Using BD technology to process and analyse the massive data generated in EC can not only meet the data analysis requirements of EC, but also bring greater economic and social benefits to enterprises.

Big Data intelligence is vital for the success and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles in ITS. These vehicles generate data on a massive scale using sensory and non-sensory platforms that require real-time storage, retrieval, processing, and visualization for decision-making.


*Using Data Analytics to Derive Business Intelligence: A Case Study*

These data being generated are both structured and unstructured, complex and simple, creating the boom of big data. Furthermore, nowadays, there are smart gadgets, the Internet of Things (IoT), and user-generated content (UGC) from social media, all contributing to the large data pool.

A major industry where data analytics has widely and successfully influenced their mode of operation is e-commerce and e-services [7]. A TDWI survey of 2009 showed that 38% of the surveyed businesses and organizations are already practicing an advanced form of data analytics, and another 85% indicated their intentions of deploying it in the future [8]. According to a 2020 Statista forecast [9], the BIA software applications market size will see an enormous worldwide increase over a six years stretch. It is estimated to grow from $14.9 billion in 2019 to $17.6 billion in 2024

Hopkins & Hawking [14] used an intrinsic case study approach to examine the role and impact of BDA and IoT, in supporting the strategy of a large logistics firm to improve driver safety, reduce operating costs, and reduce the environmental impact of its vehicles. Based on the results of the BDA, truck routing will be improved, along with recommendations for optimal fuel purchases and locations, and a forecast for proactive and predictive maintenance schedules. *(Hopkins, J., & Hawking, P.

*Big data analytics in healthcare: a systematic literature review S. Khanra, Dhir ,Amandeep, Islam* 


Big data analytics (BDA) has had a considerable influence across healthcare functions (Gu et al. [Citation2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Sáez and García-Gómez [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)), including clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and health management, among others (Raghupathi and Raghupathi [Citation2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)).

The lack of trained personnel and resistance to change in organisational routines may affect the quality of big data accumulated by the organisation (Wang, Kung, and Byrd [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Zhang et al. [Citation2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)).

#### Sensor data

Increased adoption of newer technologies make real-time data from sensors in electronic devices available to healthcare functions. These data are often accumulated from health devices (Gopal et al. [Citation2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Ma et al. [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)), Internet of Things (IoT) devices (Bravo et al. [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); George, Chacko, and Kurien [Citation2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)), and smartphone applications (Navaz et al. [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Wu et al. [Citation2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)). In general, body temperature sensors, blood oxygen sensors, and electrocardiogram sensors, among other sensors are attached to a patient’s body to monitor health parameters continuously.

BDA can serve to help hospital administrators in resource allocation (Agnihothri et al., [Citation2015](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Jindal et al. [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)), doctors in patient profiling (Narayanan and Greco [Citation2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Lin et al. [Citation2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)), and nurses in providing disease-specific patient facilitation (Boudhir, Ben Ahmed, and Soumaya [Citation2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#); Moreira et al. [Citation2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17517575.2020.1812005#)). For instance, hospital management may dynamically allocate resources for treating the Covid-19 patients by using BDA-based insights from data on confirmed cases, population density, demographics, and migration flow.

*Next Generation Business Intelligence and Analytics Quoc Duy Vo*


With sources of data sources growing steadily, traditional BI&A are evolving to provide intelligence at different scales and perspectives: operational BI, situational BI, self-service BI.

The Business Intelligence can be expressed as the automated process to collect raw data from heterogeneous sources and organize them in a systematic manner such that models and insights can be derived from the data to improve business processes. The best practice in enterprise BI architectures is split into back-end architecture, associated with the data collection and data organization, while the front-end is about the analytics and displaying the data to the user

Many of these data sources are not structured, like texts from messages posted on online social networks, or data from different sensors. This makes it challenging to design the data warehouse as a relational database while maintaining query efficiency

The increase in data opens opportunities in expanding the scope of BI beyond just a mechanism to analyse trends from historical data.

**Operational (Real-time) BI**: The competitive pressure of today’s businesses has increased the need for near real-time BI (also called operational BI).

**Situational (Situational Awareness) BI:** Situational BI is important for companies to become aware of events (e.g., positive or negative comments about their new products, natural disasters) occurring in the world that may affect their business [5].

**SSBI** is an approach to data analytics that enables end users to create analytical queries and reports without the IT department’s involvement. To free up IT staffers to focus on other tasks, the user interface in SSBI applications must be user-friendly, intuitive and easy to use, so that people who may be not tech-savvy can access and work with the corporate information.


Frontend (Data generated)

Data mining is a broad term that includes several the process as data modeling techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning in search for consistent pattern or relationship and determining some predictive information in the data analyzed from large amounts of data [11]

We will discuss the few applications of machine learning techniques in time series forecasting and sale forecasting. The description of time series data includes high dimensionality, volume and continuously evolving. The analysis of time series data is a powerful analytics tool as it helps to address questions as rate of change in user behavior with time, co-variance between the product, marketing promotion strategies, current trend in product sale, profit monitoring, determine anomalies etc. in nearly all enterprises as sales, manufacturing, mobile companies, hospitals, etc


_A Comprehensive Survey on Big Data Analytics: Characteristics, Tools and Techniques, Shahnawaz_

"Document going over history of BDA, current tools, benefits of BDA. Also goes over all the apache tools used and to be considered. It serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding the current state of analytics, encompassing foundational concepts, challenges, advanced solutions, and future prospects in the light of big data V's"

Big data refers to vast, complex, diverse datasets that challenge conventional processing and analysis methods. Big data grows continuously in quantity and variety and originates from sources like social media, IoT devices, transactional records, machine data, geospatial information, and public datasets


**Different Kinds of analytics:**

 Analysis of big data can be done through various techniques tailored to specific needs, such as descriptive analytics [92], which provides an overview of what has happened; diagnostic analytics [76], which delves into why it happened; predictive analytics [51], which forecasts future trends; prescriptive analytics [57] offers recommendations for future actions and cognitive analytics mimics human thought processes to interpret complex data [49]


*What Is (Not) Big Data Based on Its 7Vs Challenges: A Survey, Cristian*



*Survey on Growth of Business using Data Analytics for Business Intelligence in Real-Time world*

"Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics has been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption." The survey highlights that "real-time BI implementations deliver actionable information about business operations as they occur, with negligible latency. These systems typically provide more operational rather than strategic information. The benefit of real-time BI is the ability to respond to changing business conditions with minimal delay." (2024)

_Low-Code Development Platforms – A Literature Review_

"Low-code development platforms (LCDPs) empower business analysts and subject matter experts to create data-driven applications with minimal coding requirements. This democratization of development has been particularly impactful in BI implementations where business users can build their own dashboards and analytical applications." The review notes that "by 2024, low-code application development will be responsible for more than 65% of application development activity." (Prinz, 2021)

_Designing Data-Intensive Applications_

"We look primarily at the architecture of data systems and the ways they are integrated into data-intensive applications. Goes over useful terminology and concepts for processing, metrics for performance, and laws and principles to guide the performance of applications." The book explores how "batch processing is tremendously useful for data analytics over large datasets, but batch processing also confines us to operate on data of a known, fixed size. This limitation becomes increasingly problematic in a world of increasing data volumes and velocity." (Kleppmann, 2015)

**Importance of Business Intelligence **


Increase in smarter technologies, such as sensors, tracking, ability to gather greater amounts of data, have pushed enterprises to invest in recourses to analyse these data sources, in order to gain deeper insights and greater decision making. *Business Intelligence Based on Big Data in Innovative E-commerce Data Li Tang* It's made more significant  nowadays, there are smart gadgets, the Internet of Things (IoT), and user-generated content (UGC) from social media, all contributing to the large data pool.

Nearly all industries, at large enough scale increase in data use and storage, such as with the case of smarter technologies including sensors, internet of things devices, user-generated content such as feedback or tracking user action etc. *Using Data Analytics to Derive Business Intelligence: A Case Study* In response, enterprises have pushed to invest in resources to analyse this data to gain deeper insight and greater decision making *Business Intelligence Based on Big Data in Innovative E-commerce Data Li Tang* 

**Business in Intelligence in application in industries and entrerpise. Going over there Usecase**

On the data processing front, stream processing has changed everything. Apache frameworks like Kafka, Spark, and Flink have transformed how organizations handle data. As described in the "*Storm@twitter*" paper, tools like Storm provide "real-time fault-tolerant and distributed stream data processing" capabilities that enable "personalization and search relevance computations, stream analysis, and continuous computation." This isn't just academic – major platforms like Twitter rely on these technologies to process over 500 million tweets daily.

Industries that in particular that have various amounts of active moving components, such as transportation, manufacturing, E-commerce generate various amounts of data with various sensors, logs and []. Ahmad asserts this created greater demand with real-time storage and processing, for purposes of visualisation to gather greater insight .  *Making Sense of Big Data in Intelligent Transportation Systems: Current Trends, Challenges and Future Directions c Ahmad Jan,* 

Whether it be streaming platforms using analytical ML models for greater recommendations to clients, *Using Data Analytics to Derive Business Intelligence: A Case Study* or in healthcare to support clinical decision and health management *Big data analytics in healthcare: a systematic literature review S. Khanra, Dhir ,Amandeep, Islam*, BDA has become an essential part of planning for management across various industries.

Beyond even aiding management of logistics, a key solution BI provides is predicative maintenance tools which is applicable for almost all sectors to predict future trends, or outcomes to certain changes. Industries and processes such as recommendation systems for streaming service, audits,

Visualization technologies have evolved tremendously, with tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker making data exploration more intuitive. The emphasis on self-service capabilities reflects the industry trend where "SSBI is an approach to data analytics that enables end users to create analytical queries and reports without the IT department's involvement" (Vo). This democratization requires interfaces that are "user-friendly, intuitive and easy to use, so that people who may be not tech-savvy can access and work with the corporate information."


**What are some advancements with BI Tools available and how they approach BI? This can include Apache frameworks, cloud, Visualisation tools etc. **


How important is BDA for applications

**What is  the Process for business data analytics in how it's applied typically? what i mean is, what's requirements for it to be used successfuly?**

Traditional data warehouse approaches typically divide content into "three parts: overall enterprise data, business data, and business activities" (Li Tang), providing a comprehensive foundation for analysis. Modern implementations often separate concerns, with "enterprise BI architectures split into back-end architecture, associated with the data collection and data organization, while the front-end is about the analytics and displaying the data to the user" (Vo).

Organizations need robust data governance processes to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency. This becomes especially challenging when dealing with the "7Vs" of describing big data characteristics – "volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value, variability, and visualization" (MDPI) – each presenting unique quality challenges that must be addressed.


**What Issues can occur with Big Data Analytics and BI, both in application industry but also in genereal?**


Effectively utilising BI and BDA for a given company can be incredibly taxing and may require a large overhaul to previous approach for handling data. S.Khanra found that that in healthcare sectors, lack of trained personnel and weariness to change approach, can deeply affect the quality of data accumulated. *Big data analytics in healthcare: a systematic literature review S. Khanra, Dhir ,Amandeep, Islam*  Beyond just having unstructured data that doesn't have a defined schema or model, requiring large reworking to query and analyse data, storage of data, range of data collected and not having individuals to ensure the quality of this data can deeply affect any useful insight gained.

Successful implementations typically involve extensive stakeholder engagement, training programs, and intuitive interfaces that make analytics accessible to non-technical users. This approach aligns with the industry trend toward self-service BI that "enables end users to create analytical queries and reports without the IT department's involvement" (Vo).


**What's included in data analytics typically in the context of big data analysis in enterprise?**

Analyits in industires can come in various forms to aid descion making, including evaluating trends of past data across vast amount of time, predictive analysis, Viewing current Key Performance Indexes (KPI's) for a given industry. 

Descriptive analytics forms the foundation, helping organizations understand what happened in the past. This includes traditional business reporting, dashboards showing key performance indicators, and basic trend analysis. Activities like "analyzing revenue trends by product and region" provide essential context for business decision-making. While seemingly basic, effective descriptive analytics requires clean, integrated data and thoughtful visualization to make insights accessible.

Predictive analytics represents a significant advancement, leveraging historical patterns to forecast future outcomes. As highlighted in "Deep Learning-Empowered Big Data Analytics," advanced techniques can "identify potential linkage between features and possible risks, raise important decision for medical diagnosis, and provide precious advice for better healthcare treatment and lifestyle." These capabilities span industries, with "deep learning algorithms efficiently processing massive amounts of data and extracting meaningful patterns that human analysts might miss."

*Requirements and Characteristics of Big Data*

Big data is a typically defined as being the processing of vast, heterogeneous data sets to aid some analysis and process. _A Comprehensive Survey on Big Data Analytics: Characteristics, Tools and Techniques, Shahnawaz_ 

This cna be hepled further defined via 7v's describing it's characteristics such as, volume,variety,Veracity,Value, Visualisation,Variabliity. Essentially defing big data as the ability to draw insights from  large. dynamic and varied data sets, that consist of constant data flow, still working despite changes to sctructure. Regardless of the stage of structuring data used is in, should be abke to gain insight, and track changes to data. *What Is (Not) Big Data Based on Its 7Vs Challenges: A Survey, Cristian*
