Units are measurement of insulin where 1 unit is 0.01 ml. Those with type 1 diabetes can need anywhere from - from 50 to 100+ units daily, depending on factors like age, health and weight.

Some individuals with Type 2 diabetes also use insulin, though their reliance and daily dosages may vary.

Insulin must be stored at 2–8°Cto remain effective.
Exposure to high temperatures, even briefly, can degrade its efficacy, risking health and increasing costs due to wastage.
Freezing however is a much larger issue since, if it freeze's, it is completely ineffective. Even slight unthawing renders it useless
