Rough draft of plan

By then end of November, finish most of the features of project, which include, the query building, map features, deployment, live data and testing.

Ask your supervisor to review the work done so far and if any more changes need to be done to make it more affective. And if I'm ready to write a report.

As I'm going through and making sure each feature is complete, write notes along side it for how it was made and why certain things were done so it can be added to the final report.

Don't really worry about writing the final report for now tbh.

[[This Week]]
Calendar Week 
- 51
  - [x] Finish Test data, so putting in it's own unqiue datasources/scripts to be pulled from later [[Factory Plan.canvas|Factory Plan]] [[example Test Data]]
  - [ ] Finish a general look on figma or just raw html.
  - [ ] Look over other manufacturing or plant data to see if you can create examples for those too
  - [ ] Create the base elements of the database
  - [ ] Look over other reports and the videos to see approach needed.
  - [ ] Make and finish plan/Gantt chart for up until Jan 15 to see what work needs to be done
  - [ ] Test and see how stack and hosting would work and what is/isn't necessary to implement.
 
Currently Calendar Week 43. Last week is calendar 48.

- 43: 
  Main focus on finishing that map designer for 2d, connecting it to a data source a actual data source/Kafka stream and visualising live data through it.
  If i can do that, It can also do the same for card html elements and at least pass the data to chart if need be.
  Advanced features like heatmaps, or the getting the image of the map and associating each node with it, might be much.
  
- 44:
   Want to be able to add data sources and generate the queries for them. So designing the query builder. For this, we would also want to expand our test data, so we'll need a python script or some sort to add fake data into different data sources for us to use and add back into the site.
   
- 45:
  Probably flesh out and expand the features for the last 2 if not finished yet.
  
- 46: 
  Work on the page editor and chart builder. Probably the hardest so page editor takes priority.

- 47 and 48:
  Build what will be the actual final app that combines all these smalle features, with DENO since that seems easier. Don't worry about scss being too nice or nicely written.
  
  At this point, the testing would be mostly done so build an app with that design.
