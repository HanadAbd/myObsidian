Summary:

The fictional city of Omelas has ever pleasure that can exist with no injustice and only great people and kindness. The only condition for this happiness is one child must suffer infinite suffering, with any kindness ending the peace in Omelas. Different ideas from amongst the older citizens as to why this must be maintained and down playing the impact, but those who can't accept the reality decide to walk away from the city, to never return. 


Keys ideas:

- "Injustice anywhere and is injustice everywhere", key idea being Omelas can not be a perfect city or even close to it, if it can only maintained with such violence, even during it's closest time
- Unknowns - 3 key unknowns exist, what was the city like before this condition, what would walking away from this system even look like and lastly, what happens if the child was freed? If everything goes to shit, would that still be a good enough, how about the suffering of more children, and death and disease running rampant? 

Issues with the story:
- Already settles on the answer of leaving being the most noble of response, even though it could never possible effect the child. It views leaving like a way of fighting back against the city despite it being incredibly passive and not even making a scene. Protest so gentle and singular, it genuinely raises the question of it being a meaningless act 
- incredible over simplification since it directly agrees 
- views leaving Omelas as even being an option. Do those who leave forget about the child? Because they don't gain anymore from the child besides what they've received for years, do they feel less guilty?
