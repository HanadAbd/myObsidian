## Day

08:00 - 17:00 9 


08:00 - 12:00 Intilasaition of connection details and rest requests

- [x] Plan for today 8:00 - 8:15
- [x] Finish making notes for creating and handling requests 8:15 - 8:40
- [x] Create sql scripts in order to create each part of production database, based on mode e.g. running on cloud therefore 1 prod database that manages workspaces and users and that's it, user provides their database, or it runs locally so needs prod db to run and initialise 8:45 - 10:10 

	Different modes include: 
	- Server run's on cloud e.g. Azure and then you pass the details of your workspace and production database to run on that. So that means cloud has 1 database in order to manage all these other database
	- Server run's locally, so a user starts the application and passes Postgres database in order to manage all other workspaces, and in necessary, create a workspace using that same database or can use another one.

- [ ] Finish the connection service, in the sense of returning an object that has connection details to each source, and also can accept updates to these details 10:15 - 11:20
- [ ] Create rest API requests in order to add entries to the ETL pipeline (e.g. new data source, new step, new transformation) as well as to get pipeline details when clicking on their id 11:25-12:30

12:30 - 15:00 Handle request for pipelines and queries

- [ ] Handle requests for queries. This might be it's own separate service or large part of the ETL process functionality of breaking do 12:35 - 14:00
- [ ] 


15:00 - 17:00 Finish on test data page as well as make plans for tomorrow



20:00 - 21:30
