- [x] Add test data script to the main application and have it run there, with successful logs being added to a log file instead of fmt 11:15 - 12:10
- [ ] Connect this to the test data page (for now just try console.log ing it) 12:15 - 12:50
- [ ] Create functions to get the relevant data from the page and to have it be loaded to final test data application (doesn't need to be accurate for now) and create the ui to display it (except graph) 12:55 - 13:55
- [ ] Finish anything that's left 14:00 - 14:40 

- [ ] Work on the graph element, just in terms of getting data from factory and appending it to the element 15:10 - 16:10
- [ ] Make it response to live data by demonstrating pinging and updating of the ui and tool tip via web socket connections. As much as you can do 16:10 - 17:10
