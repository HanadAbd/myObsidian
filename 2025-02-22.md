## Requirements

- [ ] **Basic test data** for the application and factory Floor
- [ ] **Test and CI/CD system** for GitHub to test that there is test data, as well as testing the implementation of each service
- [ ] **ETL and Appending of data to system** Start system that appends all data from all data sources into a PostgreSQL database once doing ETL (So deciding which data to keep according to data source, transforming it to be more useful and then loading it to the main database)

- [ ] 14:25 - 14:50 **Create Test data for Excel**  - As an example continue work on the excel data to include these things
- [ ] 14:55 - 15:40 **Create Machining Test Data** - Create a machining test data for postgres and as a Kafka Stream
- [ ] 15:45 - 16:25 **Create Tests for each data source** - to view each data source has test data and having test data appended too. Also create a log file for each data source to show data is still being appended to it.  
- [ ] 16:30 - 17:00 **CI/CD for Test Data Service** however that would work, possible unit test to see if it's failing or not
- [ ] 17:05 - 17:40 **Combine Test data to test myProject**
