# Day planner

## Requirements



- Need to complete the report for now. Only thing you need to leave blank is testing results and evaluation results.


## Day

- Day plan 13:03 - 13:10

- [ ] Finish basic sections 13:10 - 14:00
- This includes project management section ,conclusion ,different KPI's ,aggregates, and reports used for those kind of analysis (don't need to delve into ML or predictive analysis or other type of analysis). Also explain testing metrics used and implementations for testing used. Create a complicated enough situation and query to go over the use case used for the repot and query.

- [ ] 14:10 - 15:00
- Make notes on data pipelines, including there requirements, different implementations, what they are used for, and important considerations for them. Use as much information you've gotten before

- dbt
- google dataflow
- 

- [ ] 15:10 - 16:00 
- Make notes about distributed programming, where it's used for in stream processing and Lambda architecture. Considerations and requirements for such a solution. Modern implementations of them and how they work.

- [ ] 16:10 - 17:00 
- Make notes about incremental computing, including how aggregates are converted, how windowing works and relation to it, query across event time as opposed to process time, again how would work in the context of an example.

get cards and drinks
19:00 - 21:00 Using as much as was done before and notes already made/derived, complete background reasearch section.

Start writing Design and implementaiton.

Spend an hour on discussion and how it would work. 

Then prrof read what has been done so far.



- [ ] Complete testing section
- [ ] Complete structure for Discussion section
- [ ] Complete image for figma and query.
- [x] Create plan for tomorrow
- [x]   Complete Conclusion
