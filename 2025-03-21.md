# Day planner

## Requirements

- test data
- Creating admin page
- Creating a settings page for the workspace.
- API request to create new workspace, new data sources, pipelines etc.
- Research how queries would work for IVM's and incremental views.

- Finishing test data in terms of how much is added, how visible certain values on the page are such as, amount of nodes, data transferred e.g.
- Create an API request in order update the 


## Day

11:00 - 14:00 Finishing test data page.

14:00 -17:00 Creating additional pages and designs as well as researching how queries would work

- [x] Plan for today 11:00 - 11:15
- [x] Create an API that pulls data for a given selected node and return's it's configuration data 11:15 -11:35
- [x] Do the same but in reverse, so for setting the value. 11:40 - 12:10
- [x] Create a list of useful information to return instead of just random components. And then return those elements. 12:15 - 12:30
- [ ] Flesh out the graph more in order to reconnect as well as accurately display visually, changes of state as well as transitions. 12:35 - 13:20
- [ ] Create more data/nodes. 13:20 - 14:00 
  
  
- [ ] Finish what's left for test data page. Should be able to visually see those changes to certain parameters such as rate for system in general as well as changing node parameters
- [ ] Design what is needed for admin page, as well as workspace configuration page, as well as perhaps, user settings.
- [ ] Create an API to add ETL Steps and data sources and add them to the prod database.
